# Trigger_threads

This is a multi-threads version of the Trigger program (https://github.com/zxh298/Trigger).

As it is too slow to search trigger of with more than five observed variables, so we modify the original Trigger program by running on
four threads. This multi-threads version is much faster but runs with more CPU usage. The number of threads could depend on the number of the (logical) cores of your CPU, but we fix to four for now.

"Separated" or "Isolated" means one or more variables are disconnected in the structure, For example A is a separated variables in 
the network (A,B,C,D): A B->C<-D
